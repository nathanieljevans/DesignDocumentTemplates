# Overview 

*introduction of a paragraph or two describing the system*


---

# 1. User Requirements

## 1.1 User Characteristics  
*Provide here the characteristics of a typical user of the system (target audience). List any technical background or expected prior experience.*  

## 1.2 System's Functionality  
*Provide here an overview of the system and what the overall intention of the system is.* 
      
## 1.3 User Interfaces   
*Provide here a brief description of how the user will interact with the system.*

## 1.4 Functional Requirements 
*List here the functional requirements of the system. Functional requirements are requirements that specify __what__ the system should do and can be thought of as 'the system must do <requirement\>'. Implementation details for each requirement should be addressed in the system design document. An example of a functional requirement would be 'the system utilizes Java version...' This list can become quite extensive and for best practice each requirement should be issued its own unique name, number, and be accompanied by a description.*

# 2. System Requirements  
*List here the non-functional requirements of the system. Non-Functional requirements are requirements that specify __how__ the system should act and can be thought of as 'the system shall be <requirement\>'. An example of a non-functional requirement would be 'the system input should be able to handle any file smaller than...'*


## 2.1 Functional Requirements
*List here the functional requirements of the system. Functional requirements are requirements that specify __what__ the system should do and can be thought of as 'the system must do <requirement\>'. Implementation details for each requirement should be addressed in the system design document. An example of a functional requirement would be 'the system utilizes Java version...' This list can become quite extensive and for best practice each requirement should be issued its own unique name, number, and be accompanied by a description.*
